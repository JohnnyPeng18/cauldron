Cauldron Kernel

The Cauldron kernel container serves as remote kernel execution environment,
creating a separation from the Cauldron UI. This makes it possible to work on
one host while running the notebook code on another. Running the container
looks like:

$ docker run -p 5010:5010 swernst/cauldron:current-standard

The key is publishing the 5010 container port to the host environment in
some fashion so that the kernel is accessible from outside of the container.
