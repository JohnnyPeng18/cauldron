# Contributing to Cauldron
We welcome all contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas. We are working on our contribution guidelines, but in the meantime we can help you get started if you contact us directly on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/cauldron-notebook/Lobby).

# Reporting Bugs
The goal of the bug report is to explain to us how to reproduce the bug on our computers. Only submit a report for a bug you can reproduce. Limit your report to one bug (no bug is too small to report). Include as much detail as possible in clear, precise English.  Please include in your report:
* A title that explains the bug  in a few words
* The steps to reproduce the bug
* Expected results
* Actual results
* What you have tried to fix the bug
* The version of Cauldron
* Versions of all relevant software, e.g., python, operating systems, etc.

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful.
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
